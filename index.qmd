This is John's Quarto website sandbox. Our objective here is to provide a one-stop shop for building out a course/workshop website with the following functionality:

1.  Static webpages
2.  Presentations
3.  Shiny Apps
4.  Interactive tutorials.

In addition, we'll play around with CSS styling and publishing.

# Workflow

1.  Created a new Quarto website project within Rstudio.

2.  Created some new content (e.g., presentation, static doc, etc.)

3.  Committed locally, then connected to github using usethis::use_github()
